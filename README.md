Hi. This is a basic compression exercise (emphasis on basic) to help me learn
about how simple data compression algorithms work.

At the moment, this repo includes just huffman coding, although I'm thinknig
about possibly doing arithmetic coding at some point. I've followed the basic
steps laid out in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) for
the coding algorithm.
